# Screen Capture
A simple tool for taking screenshots. You can take fullscreen screenshots or select which part of the screen you want to capture.

## How to run
- Install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- run (double click) the "ScreenCapture.jar" file from this repository

## Usage
After running the program, you won't see any window, because Screen Capture opens as a window outside of the screen. This allows the user to have the program running without any blocking window. You can access it by moving the mouse cursor up to the middle of the screen. Now you can click on either "capture fullscreen" or "capture rectangle selection" to take a screenshot. After taking a screenshot, a new window will open showing you the screenshot. If you want to save it, you can click on the save button located at the bottom left. If you choose to take a rectangle selection screenshot, you will see a zoom of the area around your cursor. To start the selection, click anywhere on the screen and then again to finish the selection.
